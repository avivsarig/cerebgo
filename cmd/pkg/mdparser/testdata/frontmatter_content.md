## Wacky Walrus Goes Shopping 🛒

Wacky Walrus had one simple goal: buy a fish sandwich. But nothing is ever simple when you're a walrus in a human supermarket.

- **Aisle 1**: Slipped on a puddle, landed in a pyramid of tuna cans. _"Good thing I like tuna!"_ 🐟
- **Aisle 3**: Mistook the frozen fish display for a "grab-and-go buffet." Security disagreed.
- **Checkout**: The cashier asked for his loyalty card. Wacky produced a sardine tin. _"Close enough, right?"_

## Moral of the Story 🐾

Even walruses can't resist a good sale... but they should probably stick to seafood markets. 😄
